## Annotated Bibliography

**Cheng, Ian. Emissary's Guide To Worlding. Metis Suns, 2018.**

In this book, digital artist Ian Cheng describes strategies for “Worlding”, a term described by the author as “the art of conceiving, incubating, triggering and nurturing an infinite game”. These are some of the strategies he used to conceive the Emissary Trilogy, a series of live simulations or virtual ecosystems that are endlessly evolving characters placed within changing environments. Cheng describes four patterns of creative problem solving as masks; director, emissary, cartoonist and hacker each have a role to play in creating interest and autonomy in an infinite game. The director adds value through narrative making and mythology eg. Hayao Miyazaki. The emissary adds value through long-term health and growth of the life of the system eg. Kris Jenner. Cartoonists add value through emotional resonance and symbolism eg Oprah Winfrey. Hacker adds value through disruptive exploitation to generate surprise mechanics eg Elon Musk. This book contains useful strategies for developing immersive environments for simulations, it puts a particular emphasis on developing autonomy in the simulation so it is able to generate emergent behaviours. My interest in Cheng’s medium is the creative process, but as a viewer how much can you watch? How much is worth watching? How can interesting behaviour stay interesting over time?

A research paper documenting the process of creation for We feel fine a web-based data visualization created by artist Jonathan Harris (Number 27) and researcher Sepandar D. Kamvar (Stanford University). The application consists of a web crawler and data visualization. The web crawler collects expressions of emotions from social media and blogs by extracting sentences that include the words “I feel” or “I am feeling” as well as metadata such as gender age, location, author, current weather and images, contextualizing the emotion in the post by what going on in its surroundings. The data is then organized into interactive charts, graphs and other visualization that allows the viewer user to focus on individual entries. For example, the viewer can focus on particular metadata events to answer questions like “How do people feel when it rains?” or the example is given in the research paper “How did young people in Ohio feel when Obama was elected?” I’m extremely interested in this method of data visualization, as It is particularly affective, it is able to personify the massive data set into singular narratives. This is a similar strategy used by the creators of Bear71, an interactive documentary that immerses the viewer in the first-person perspective of a female grizzly bear to highlight the loss of its natural habitat in the Anthropocene. Both pieces allow viewers to broaden and magnify the scope of the narrative to view the narrative in the context of its surroundings. This was an interactive web application but has recently been deprecated on most browsers. The data was scraped between 2005-2006, at the time this could have represented the sentiment on the internet but since then its influence on us has grown exponentially. This particular data set of emotions may no longer reflect how people feel in 2020 but it is still a viable method for data visualization.

This was a study conducted by Nils Köbis, Luca Mossink at the Department of Economics & Center for Experimental Economics and Political Decision making (CREED), University of Amsterdam. The study asks participants to identify poetry that is written by humans and AI-Generated. The authors also take into account the quality of the poems by including categories for prominent writers and non professionally written poems. Their findings indicate that humans are not able to differentiate poetry written by a human from poetry generated by AI by an error rate of 50%. But it is important to note that humans play a significant role in the poem selection process for AI-generated writings. Where the poem selection was random participants were able to identify the AI-generated writing with better accuracy. The particularly interesting finding of this study was the participants would prefer the human-written text if told the method of production. They noted an uncanny valley effect where the participants were averse to the AI-generated writing and were overly confident in their ability to identify non-human writing.

This essay is an examination of the interactive documentary Bear 71 (2012) by Leanne Allison and Jeremy Mendes written by Katey Castellano (Department of English, James Madison University, USA). The documentary was created using data collected by several cameras, fur traps and GPS trackers over the course of 8 years in Banff National Park. The story is told through the first-person perspective of a female grizzly bear; it details the loss of its habitat and death caused by humans encroachment. Castellano describes two strategies used by the creators of the documentary to re-frame the data. First, the singular experience of the bear as a voice-over in an autothanatography style (omniscient narrator who is already dead), anthropomorphizing the bear. The second strategy the grid view/ users navigation framed animal engagement as a layered ecosystem issue that includes humans. The bear's story is told in the context of the forest allowing viewers to view other stories of animals in the forest. These two techniques are affective, and used similarly in “We Feel Fine”. Allowing the viewer to navigate through various levels of data and isolate individual moments creates an intimate interaction with an extremely large data set.

Marian Mazzone (Department of Art & Architectural History, College of Charleston) and 
Ahmed Elgammal (Department of Computer Science, Rutgers University) describes a method for using AI for art, called AICAN (Artificial Intelligence Creative Adversarial Network). The paper describes AI as a tool for the artist, the artist’s role is in the image input stage (pre-curation), tweaks the AI Generative model and in the post-curation stage, it argues this process falls in the category of conceptual art. The desired output of the AICAN method is emergent visuals, they reference the phenomena in psychology  “Daniel E. Berlyne (1924–1976) studied the basics of the psychology of aesthetics for several decades and pointed out that novelty, surprisingness, complexity, ambiguity, and puzzlingness are the most significant properties in stimulus relevance to studying aesthetic phenomena” A study conducted by the authors showed that 75% of the participants thought the art generated by their network was a human artist a similar result found by Köbis and Mossink

This paper is written by Michael Mateas (artist, computer scientist), from the Computer Science Department and Studio for Creative Inquiry at Carnegie Mellon University. The author describes their own pieces that use AI and the contrast between GOFAI (Good Old Fashion AI) and AI used as an artist tool. Mateas describes the purpose of GOFAI as seeking solutions, that are grounded in task completion and realism.  To contrast this he describes the artist’s use of AI as cultural creation that focus is a concern with poetics, audience perception. “The conversational model of meaning-making. In the conversation model, art practice is conceived as the negotiation of meaning between artist and audience as mediated by the art object.” This was an interesting paper as I am concerned with the audience’s perception of this style of art.

**Walstad, Diana L. Ecology of the Planted Aquarium: a Practical Manual and Scientific Treatise for the Home Aquarist. Echinodorus, 2013.**

Diana Walstad is a medical research technician and former technical advisor for the Aquatic Gardeners Association. The “Walstad method” has gained popularity on Youtube as a go-to method for creating nano planted aquariums. Usually, the Walstad method is as an aquarium that uses no filter, no injected CO2 and minimal water changes, no fertilizers and is self-sustaining; the fish waste fertilizes the plants and the plants purify the water. This book explains the allelopathy (chemical interactions between organisms) in an aquarium and the use of plants to purify the water in order to balance the ecosystem. It describes details regarding the chemicals present in the water like nitrates, ammonia, oxygen etc. I have been extremely fascinated with self-sustaining natural ecosystems, I have had attempted several Walstad aquariums. I think this approach to developing a successful ecosystem is quite similar to Chengs’ concept of “worlding” -  nurturing an infinite game.


**Hassine, Tsila. “The zombification of Art History: How AI resurrects dead masters, and perpetuates historical biases.” (2019).**

Similar to some of the previous readings, this criticizes what the meaning and purpose of what AI in art should be. The author’s criticism regarding the use of AI is that AI perpetuates the biases of art history. Using the Next Rembrandt project as an example. A dutch research project used AI to analyze Rembrandt’s painting style and technique and attempt to create new work. Rembrandt’s subjects painting subject matter was taken into account - the faces, gender age head direction, eyes, noses, mouths and facial proportions. According to the data led them to create a portrait of a caucasian male with the average facial proportions of the given data set. Many of these types of projects seem like a conceptual experiment more than a contribution to culture. I tend to agree with Marian, and Elgammal the points of failure of the AI seem to be more interesting than the successes, in a strange way it seems to highlight the style of the artist in the errors it generates.

Final Paper
Understanding Recommendation Algorithms: Systems Storytelling
 
Introduction: The Internet has been integral to maintaining a small sense of normalcy during the COVID‐19 pandemic, allowing us to work, attend classes, shop, and view live performances online. During this time social media use has increased by 20-87% worldwide (Naeem et al., 2020), we have seen an increase in social media used for scaling and mobilization of social justice movements (Mundt et al., 2018) as well as to promote false conspiracy theories (Naeem et al., 2020). In either case, these behaviours emerge or are accelerated as a result of the feedback loop structure of recommendation algorithms. These algorithms are designed to keep the users engaged by recommending progressively extreme and partisan content (Hao, 2020). These recommendations often support confirmation biases against women of colour and other marginalized populations (Noble, 2020) and anti-scientific rhetoric (Erviti et al., 2020). Due to the function of these recommendation systems radical behaviours emerges. For example, The New York Times article “The Making of a YouTube Radical” documents Caleb Cain’s journey into a far right-wing recommendation rabbit hole that convinced him western civilization was under threat by Muslims and Marxist. This recommendation algorithm is responsible for which is responsible for 70% of users time spent on YouTube.(Hao, 2020)

Purpose: How can we use systems design, game engines, and data visualization to understand and disrupt systemic biases within social media networks created by algorithmic echo chambers?

Objectives: This creation research project requires separate phases, the first phase will collect data through a web scraping application programming interface (API). The API will collect data from a social media platform for various trending subjects, and record user engagement such as comments, retweets and likes. A network analysis will be performed on the dataset to categorize users according to their online presence— political positioning and behaviours derived from interactions with other users using a sentiment score. The data collected by the API will act as seeds for a visually-immersive ecosystem. In the second phase, a user will be able to modify the ecosystem’s behaviour by manipulating the parameters of a recommendation algorithm that influences the structure of this universe. The player will then be confronted with the emergent beings that have evolved within the system according to the player's own ruleset and behaviours gathered by the API. The ecosystem algorithmically generates flora, fauna and terrain. Each network cluster created by the API will be characterized into anthropomorphic entities with behaviours associated with their accompanying metadata, interacting within the narrative of a small town or village

Theoretical Framework: My theoretical framework will be structured around systems theory.
System theory described by Donella Meadows (2015) is a set of interconnecting entities connected in a way that produces its own pattern of behaviour over time (p. 11). The concept of a reinforcing feedback loop described in systems theory is akin to the algorithmic nature of recommendation systems. The more the loop works the further it drives the behaviour in a direction (Meadows, 2015, p. 155). Meadows describes balancing the feedback loop as a  stabling of the inputs and outputs in the system similar to a self sustaining ecosystem. The systems feedloop also has a concept called resilience, this is described as being the strength of the feedback loops’ parameter malleability before it breaks.

Methodology: As a research methodology, “creation-as-research”(Chapman & Sawchuk, 2012) situated in the computational and generative art field is well-suited for this research. The creation-as-research methodology utilizes a hands-on form of theoretical engagement to generate knowledge. A more active role in the system's creation could help us better understand how it works and where we need to intervene in order to balance this ecosystem. Echoing Whitelaw’s thoughts on the purpose of generative art for complex systems “Generative art can, and must, do more than make images of complex systems; it can tinker critically with the systems themselves, then set them running: possible worlds.” (Whitelaw, 2005, p. 3). 

Similar work: Similar work that examines recommendation algorithms observes the mechanics of the algorithm by looking at the structure of the neural network usually for optimization. Observing the neural network does not necessarily give us insight into the emergent behaviour that may rise out of the system. For example studies conducted by Gretarsson et al., verbert et al. and Vartak et al. examine algorithm systems as tools and do not examine behaviours at all. Some papers that examine impact, identify ethical challenges and scale empirically, such as Milano et al. - Recommender Systems and their Ethical Challenges and Faddoul et al. - A longitudinal analysis of YouTube’s promotion of conspiracy videos. Similar to the previously mentioned papers Algotansparancy is a web application that documents the amount of times a YouTube channel or Video is recommended, the purpose of this application is to highlight what the algorithm is unknowing promoting. 

One of my favorite web based pieces attempts to examine the Internet through data collection and sentiment analysis. We Feel Fine is a web-based data visualization created by artist Jonathan Harris (Number 27) and researcher Sepandar D. Kamvar (Stanford University) (Kamvar & Harris, 2011). The application consists of a web crawler and data visualization. The web crawler collects expressions of emotions from social media and blogs by extracting sentences that include the words “I feel” or “I am feeling” as well as metadata such as gender age, location, author, current weather and images, contextualizing the emotion in the post by what going on in its surroundings. The data is then organized into interactive charts, graphs and other visualization that allows the viewer user to focus on individual entries. For example, the viewer can focus on particular metadata events to answer questions like “How do people feel when it rains?” or the example is given in the research paper “How did young people in Ohio feel when Obama was elected?”



Expected Outcome: 
The aesthetics, mechanics and narrative development for this game have been inspired by Cheng’s “Emissaries guide to worlding” and “Emissaries trilogy”. In the Emissaries guide to wordling Cheng describes strategies for “Worlding” described as “the art of conceiving, incubating, triggering and nurturing an infinite game”. The end goal of this ecosystem is to observe the impact of endless feedback loops on the characters within the system. The mechanism that generates the narrative and characters will be inspired by elements of folklore, particularly focusing on real human conditions becoming monsters for example in Japanese folklore. “An ubume is a woman who dies just before, during, or shortly after childbirth. Her spirit is too worried about her baby to pass on peacefully and she turns into a ghost.” (Herstik, 2016). The characters behaviours will be developed by examining the API, aggressive or sad clusters will be characterized into anthropomorphic entities with an appearance and behaviour that match their characteristics. 

Referencing Harris and Kamvar’s We Feel Fine as artistic precedence (Kamvar & Harris, 2011) 
 I hope to create an installation that allows the viewer to navigate dimensions connected to social, cultural, economic implications of the data, to isolate and manipulate individual leverage points to identify the causes of emergent behaviours. This project follows the model of relational aesthetic (Bourriaud, 2009) and echoes Steyerl’s (2020) notions of using museums and game theory to construct real-time social models to test different realities to envision how one can intervene within these social systems and bring about change.
