## Annotated Bibliography

**Cheng, Ian. Emissary's Guide To Worlding. Metis Suns, 2018.**

In this book, digital artist Ian Cheng describes strategies for “Worlding”, a term described by the author as “the art of conceiving, incubating, triggering and nurturing an infinite game”. These are some of the strategies he used to conceive the Emissary Trilogy, a series of live simulations or virtual ecosystems that are endlessly evolving characters placed within changing environments. Cheng describes four patterns of creative problem solving as masks; director, emissary, cartoonist and hacker each have a role to play in creating interest and autonomy in an infinite game. The director adds value through narrative making and mythology eg. Hayao Miyazaki. The emissary adds value through long-term health and growth of the life of the system eg. Kris Jenner. Cartoonists add value through emotional resonance and symbolism eg Oprah Winfrey. Hacker adds value through disruptive exploitation to generate surprise mechanics eg Elon Musk. This book contains useful strategies for developing immersive environments for simulations, it puts a particular emphasis on developing autonomy in the simulation so it is able to generate emergent behaviours. My interest in Cheng’s medium is the creative process, but as a viewer how much can you watch? How much is worth watching? How can interesting behaviour stay interesting over time? 

**Kamvar, Sepandar D., and Jonathan Harris. “We Feel Fine and Searching the Emotional Web.” Proceedings of the Fourth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining - WSDM '11, 2011, doi:10.1145/1935826.1935854.**

A research paper documenting the process of creation for We feel fine a web-based data visualization created by artist Jonathan Harris (Number 27) and researcher Sepandar D. Kamvar (Stanford University). The application consists of a web crawler and data visualization. The web crawler collects expressions of emotions from social media and blogs by extracting sentences that include the words “I feel” or “I am feeling” as well as metadata such as gender age, location, author, current weather and images, contextualizing the emotion in the post by what going on in its surroundings. The data is then organized into interactive charts, graphs and other visualization that allows the viewer user to focus on individual entries. For example, the viewer can focus on particular metadata events to answer questions like “How do people feel when it rains?” or the example is given in the research paper “How did young people in Ohio feel when Obama was elected?” I’m extremely interested in this method of data visualization, as It is particularly affective, it is able to personify the massive data set into singular narratives. This is a similar strategy used by the creators of Bear71, an interactive documentary that immerses the viewer in the first-person perspective of a female grizzly bear to highlight the loss of its natural habitat in the Anthropocene. Both pieces allow viewers to broaden and magnify the scope of the narrative to view the narrative in the context of its surroundings. This was an interactive web application but has recently been deprecated on most browsers. The data was scraped between 2005-2006, at the time this could have represented the sentiment on the internet but since then its influence on us has grown exponentially. This particular data set of emotions may no longer reflect how people feel in 2020 but it is still a viable method for data visualization.
